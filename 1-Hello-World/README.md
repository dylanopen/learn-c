# Chapter 1: Hello World

## Project setup

The first step is to create our C project. Follow these steps:

1. Create a new folder (e.g. 'learn-c'). This will be the folder we use for our project.
2. Next, create a C source file in the folder (e.g. `hello.c`). It must end in `.c`.
3. Open the C file in a text editor, such as [VS Codium](https://vscodium.com/).

## Coding

Now lets write some code!

Copy the following code into `hello.c`:

``` c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	printf("Hello world");
	return 0;
}
```
